.APM Server vs managed intake service
====
In Elasticsearch Service, the _APM Server_ receives data from Elastic APM agents and transforms it into Elasticsearch documents.
In Elastic Cloud Serverless there is in fact no APM Server running, instead the _managed intake service_ receives and transforms data.
