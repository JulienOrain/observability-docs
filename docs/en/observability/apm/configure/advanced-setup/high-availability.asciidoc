= High Availability

status_badge::[cloud_serverless, unavailable]

To achieve high availability
you can place multiple instances of {apm-server} behind a regular HTTP load balancer,
for example HAProxy or Nginx.

The endpoint `/` always returns an `HTTP 200`.
You can configure your load balancer to send HTTP requests to this endpoint
to determine if an {apm-server} is running.
See <<apm-api-info>> for more information on that endpoint.

In case of temporal issues, like unavailable {es} or a sudden high workload,
{apm-server} does not have an internal queue to buffer requests,
but instead leverages an HTTP request timeout to act as back-pressure.

If {es} goes down, the {apm-server} will eventually deny incoming requests.
Both the {apm-server} and {apm-agent}(s) will issue logs accordingly.
