== Language-specific options

Use Elastic APM agents or an OpenTelemetry language SDK to instrument a service in the language its written in:

* <<apm-agents,*Elastic APM agents*>>: Elastic APM agents are instrumentation libraries written in the same language as your service.
* <<apm-open-telemetry,*OpenTelemetry*>>: OpenTelemetry is an open source set of APIs, SDKs, tooling, and integrations that enable the capture and management of telemetry data from your services and applications.
** This option includes Elastic Distributions of OpenTelemetry, which are customized versions of https://opentelemetry.io/docs/languages/[OpenTelemetry language SDKs] that are optimized to work with an Elastic backend.

*Not sure which method is right for you?* Compare the available options below.
